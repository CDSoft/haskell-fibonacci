# Super fast recursive Fibonacci implementation in Haskell

The Fibonacci sequence is a classical hello-world application for functional
programming. The challenge here is to get a fast implementation. We will first
show two classical implementations: the trivial recursive definition that is
very slow and the iterative version that is slightly faster.

And a third one that is blazing fast.

So here is my own version...

- the source code in Literate Haskell: [fibonacci.lhs](fibonacci.lhs)
- the document rendered in Markdown: [fibonacci.md](fibonacci.md)
